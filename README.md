### Hi there 👋

I am Priyanshu Nayan, currently in 3<sup>rd</sup> year, studying Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Patna. I like web and you can find me working on web based projects most of time. Presently I am working as Student Developer in Google Summer of Code program for Hydra Ecosystem. I am reading [Educated](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated) by Tara Westover these days. I often travel to mountains during my semester breaks. Dharamkot has been my favourite city so far 🏔
